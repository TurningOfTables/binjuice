# Bin Juice

## Description

Uses Go with the Fiber framework and Bootstrap to generate a basic html page showing what bins are next being collected in my area. Contains unnecessary CSS animations.

## Notes

Run with `go run main.go binlib.go`

By default binds to the current IP address on port 8000

**Note there is no meaningful password on the SQL database and testing authentication info is currently stored in plain text rather than in an env var or any secure way.**
